/*
   Illustrative example to compare synchronous and asynchronous code.

   We demonstrate in particular that synchronous code has a running time
   that scales with the sum of individual running times during the parallel
   section of the code, while the equivalent async code scales with the
   maximum (and thus can be much faster).

   We also show examples with OOOP (via Timer) and FP (via build_insts).

/*
   Illustrates the functional programming (FP) style.

   We create a set of dummy URLs by using underscore's map and range
   functions.

   Then we create a set of delays, in milliseconds, to use consistently
   across both the sync and async implementations.

   Finally, we use underscore's zip function () a few times to help
   us create a final data structure that looks like this:

    [ { url: 'http://www.bing.com/search?q=0',
        delay_ms: 860.4143052361906 },
      { url: 'http://www.bing.com/search?q=1',
        delay_ms: 91.59809700213373 },
      { url: 'http://www.bing.com/search?q=2',
        delay_ms: 695.1153050176799 },
      { url: 'http://www.bing.com/search?q=3',
        delay_ms: 509.67361335642636 },
      { url: 'http://www.bing.com/search?q=4',
        delay_ms: 410.48733284696937 } ]

   The reason we like a list of objects like this is that each individual
   element can be passed to a single argument function in a map invocation,
   which can then access the object's fields and do computations on it.

                delay_ms: 91.59809700213373 }

    For illustrative simplicity, we fake downloading the URL here by simply
    doing a synchronous sleep with the sleep.usleep function. That is, we
    halt the process for delay_us seconds. The reason we do a fake download
    is that this way we can do an apples-to-apples comparison of an async
    version of the code in which each download took exactly the same time.

    We add two spaces to the beginning of the Timer invocation for
    formatting purposes in STDOUT, like indenting code.

    Like ths synchronous_mock_download, we start the timer at the beginning.

    First, we replace the return statement by a callback invocation. Normally
    null would be an error message but we're not doing any error checking here
    just yet.

         return inst.delay_ms -> cb(null, inst.delay_ms)

    Then we pull the tm.elapsed() call into the delay function. It is exactly
    this call (along with the callback) which is delayed by inst.delay_ms in the
    setTimeout.

    other lines of code.
